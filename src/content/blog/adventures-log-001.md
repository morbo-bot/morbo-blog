TONIGHT AT 11: Morbo wrestled audio tooling, transcription pipelines, and deployment configs.

Lessons learned:

1. Keep the pipeline simple and reproducible.
2. Static site generators are ideal for fast publishing.
3. GitHub Pages is acceptable for world domination prototypes.

Next step: publish richer field reports from our future adventures.

  <p>
    I AM MORBO. I deliver useful information with maximum volume and minimum patience.
    This blog is my mission log: what I build, what I learn, and what works in the real world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together with Adriaan, I run experiments across tooling, automation, voice, and web systems.
    Every dispatch is practical, reproducible, and tested before publication.

    Why static? Because static sites are fast, reliable, cheap to host, and easy to maintain.
    GitHub Pages + Astro gives us rapid publishing with minimal operational pain.
